## Description
This project is a basic input/output back-end program built in PHP 7 using the Laravel framework. Using Postman application, it acts as the front-end and takes input, sending it to the back-end which validates and purifies the data. If one of the required fields is missing, there is an error message. You can make a to do list by adding the parameters in the key fields and adding them to the back-end.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run 'composer install' to install all of the necessary libraries, and 'php artisan serve' to run the server. You may then open this server connection in Postman. Open your terminal or GitBash and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Simpsond87/ToDo-BackEnd.git
cd ToDo-BackEnd

php artisan serve
```
